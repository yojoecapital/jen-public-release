## Release Notes for Version 1.0.0

I'm excited to announce the release of **Jen 1.0.0**, its first official release! Jen is a locally played turn-based game played on a grid of square tiles, where players control units to dominate the board. The game revolves around two main units, **Tanks** and **Cities**. Tanks can fight other units or turn into Cities. Cities collect stock and use it to build more tanks. The goal is to be the last player on the board.

## Key Features:

- **Intuitive Gameplay Mechanics**: Drag and drop interface for moving Tanks, building Cities, and managing your resources.
- **Diplomacy System**: Propose and manage deals with other players, including stock exchanges and armistice agreements.
- **Customizable Play Settings**: Adjust board dimensions, stock limits, and special tile settings to create unique matches.
- **Tactical Unit Management**: Handle stock, Tanks, and Cities strategically to outlast your opponents.
